Your performance on each bundle determines your rough letter grade (full letters). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each category below.\n\nGrading Scheme\n\n\nTable of letter grades\n\nLetter grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter grade\nReading Quizzes\nUnit Problems\nFinal Portfolio\nMidterm and Final\nPresentation\n\n\n\n\nD\nEarn 70% of the points\nComplete 5 of 15 problems\nPass 3 of 5 problems\nOptional\nOptional (replaces a grade item)\n\n\nC\nEarn 70% of the points\nComplete 8 of 15 problems\nPass 4 of 5 problems\nAttempt one\nOptional (replaces a grade item)\n\n\nB\nEarn 70% of the points\nComplete 12 of 15 problems\nPass all 5 problems\nPass one\nMust attempt 1 (replaces a grade item)\n\n\nA\nEarn 70% of the points\nComplete all 15 problems\nPass all 5 problems, plus at least 1 E\nPass both\nMust attempt 1 (replaces a grade item)\n\n\n\n\n\nBundle visualization\n\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPointsCompletionE/M/U/N\n\n\nReading quizzes will be graded on a points scale: each quiz has 10 problems and each is worth 1 point.\n\n\nThe portfolio problems for each unit will be graded on completion. You will be able to see the solutions and self-assess your work, but I will look to ensure that a sincere attempt was made on each problem.\n\n\nThe individual final portfolio problems, presentations, and the midterm and final will be graded on the following scale:\n\nE: excellent – this is a thorough and correct response that demonstrates excellent understanding of the concepts and makes proper use of the mathematical skills expected in this class.\nM: meets expectations – this is a response that demonstrates solid understanding of the concepts but perhaps includes some small mathematical errors or minor conceptual mistakes.\nU: unsatisfactory / does not meet expectations – this is an answer that applies the concepts incorrectly, misunderstands the point of the question, does not complete the question, fails to follow instructions, and/or contains significant mathematical errors\nN: no submission – if you turn nothing in, you will receive an N.\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. To get an A or B in this class, you must achieve some Es (see the grading scheme)\nU and N are considered failing grades.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading categories\n\nReading QuizzesUnit ProblemsFinal PortfolioTestsPresentations\n\n\nIn order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. We will spend most of our time in class practicing problem solving, and before class you will need to read the appropriate sections of the book and respond to a quiz. Some readings are longer than others (and I’ve included the page count in the course schedule so you can be prepared), but every reading quiz is 10 questions.\nGiven the purpose of the reading quizzes, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\n\n\nEach unit (except for the unit on quantum weirdness) will have three problems similar to what we work on in class, but larger in scope and/or difficulty. These problems will be due shortly after the unit is over, and will be graded on completion.\nYou may work with classmates on these problems, but please be sure to give credit, which means naming each person you worked with and describing in a sentence or two the contribution they made.\nYou may request extensions on the unit problems using the extension form.\n\n\nThe idea for this final portfolio assignment is to demonstrate what you have learned in the course and to create something for which you can take ownership and feel proud. We will get a lot of practice with problem solving this semester, and this is a chance to go back and curate some of what you have done.\nThe intended audience is a fellow student who had not previously seen the unit questions you have chosen, but is curious to know how to solve them. For example, you could imagine yourself at the beginning of the semester, or a classmate earlier this semester who was unsure how to approach a problem. Would that intended audience be able to understand your approach and your logic? Would they feel empowered to learn based on what you have created for them?\nThe assignment will involve redoing 5 problems (one from each unit) in a manner that clearly presents the logic and reasoning behind your answers. It will be useful to restate the problem in your own words, clearly identifying known and unknown quantities. You will then want to describe and demonstrate your approach to solving the problem. Once you arrive at an answer, it will also be helpful to reflect on the implications of that answer. This could include a consideration of how the answer depends on certain variables, or how the answer might be different for a slightly different situation.\nEach problem is graded on an E/M/U/N scale, and an E and M are both considered passing grades.\nYou may request an extension on the final portfolio using the extension form. Please note, however, that deadline cannot be extended beyond the end of final exam period.\n\n\nThere will be one midterm, which will be given during class time, and one final, which will be given during the scheduled final exam time. You may bring a double-sided 8.5”x11” sheet of paper with equations and notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your test.\nThese are graded on an E/M/U/N scale.\n\n\nAfter every unit, you will have a chance to present one of the problems to the class in a group of up to three. You should teach the problem in a step-by-step way – you can skip some algebra but should not skip any conceptual steps, you should explain your reasoning for each step, and you should idenitify and resolve at least one common challenge or misconception that can arise when solving the problem.\nYou will be graded on the correctness and completeness of the solution, clarity of your explanation, soundness of your reasoning, and resolution of the common challenge.\nThese are graded on an E/M/U/N scale, and you may use your presentation score to replace one of the following:\n\nyour reading quiz score for the semester (an M or higher gives you full credit)\none unit worth of problems (an M or higher gives you full credit for one unit’s problems)\none final portfolio problem\nyour midterm or final exam grade\n\nI will always replace the grade item that most benefits you, and will never replace a better score with a worse one. The Presentations can only help you.\nSince the presentations are scheduled for specific days, you cannot request an extension.\nIf you want to get a B or higher in the class, you have to at least try a presentation. Given the limitations on time, you may not be able to do more than one – I will prioritize students who have not yet done a presentation on the sign-up sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading boosts\n\nEffort BoostProblem-Solver BoostGrowth BoostSelf-Assessment Boost\n\n\nIf you earn 85% of the reading quiz points, turn in every unit problem, turn in a complete portfolio, attempt both exams, and do a presentation, you will gain a grade round up for effort, regardless of the outcome of your work.\n\n\nIf you earn more than one E on your final portfolio, you will get a grade round-up\n\n\nIf you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the semester, I reserve the right to round your grade up.\n\n\nIf you earn a U on the midterm, you can correct your work for a grade round-up. To do this you must:\n\nRe-solve the midterm (the whole problem) from scratch\nCompare any places where your new work is different from your previous work and explain in writing the mistakes you made and the outcomes\nEmail me your write-up\nSchedule a 15 minute meeting with me to talk over your write-up (the write-up needs to be submitted at least 24 hours in advance of this meeting)",
