    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nAssignments fall into “bundles,” which contribute to your grade in specific ways. Your performance on each bundle determines your rough letter grade (full letters). Beyond that, you can achieve grade boosts, which round your grade up, e.g. from a B to a B+, or a B+ to an A-.\nYou can learn more about each category below.\n\nGrading Scheme\n\n\nTable of letter grades\n\nLetter grades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter grade\nPre-Class Quizzes\nWHW + self-assessments\nUnit tests (x3)\nFinal Project (5 components)\n\n\n\n\nD\nEarn 75% of the points\nEarn 75% of the points\nAt least M on 1\nProposal and Presentation/Report\n\n\nC\nEarn 75% of the points\nEarn 75% of the points\nAt least M on 2\nProposal and Presentation/Report plus any other component\n\n\nB\nEarn 85% of the points\nEarn 85% of the points\nAt least M on all 3\nProposal and Presentation/Report plus any 2 other components\n\n\nA\nEarn 85% of the points\nEarn 85% of the points\nAt least M on all 3, plus 1 E\nComplete all components\n\n\n\n\n\nBundle visualization\n\n\n\nGrading scales\n\nPointsCompletionE/M/U/N\n\n\nHomeworks and pre-class quizzes will be graded on a points scale. Your total grade for the bundle will be your average points on the assignments. Remember that these are not graded on “correctness” but rather on engaging in good faith.\n\n\nThe five final project components will each have objectives you must meet for them to be considered “complete.” These will be clearly laid out for each component so you know exactly what to do to complete them.\n\n\nThe unit tests will be graded on the following scale:\n\nE: excellent – this is a thorough and correct response that demonstrates excellent understanding of the concepts and makes proper use of the mathematical skills expected in this class.\nM: meets expectations – this is a response that demonstrates solid understanding of the concepts but perhaps includes some small mathematical errors or minor conceptual mistakes.\nU: unsatisfactory / does not meet expectations – this is an answer that applies the concepts incorrectly, misunderstands the point of the question, does not complete the question, fails to follow instructions, and/or contains significant mathematical errors\nN: no submission – if you do not take the test, you will receive an N.\n\nE and M are considered passing grades. U and N are considered failing grades, but you have one chance to make up that grade, as every test will be given twice.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading categories\n\nPre-Class QuizzesWHW and self-assessmentUnit testsFinal Project\n\n\nIn order to get the most out of class, you need to prepare. We will spend most of our time in class practicing problem solving, and before class you will need to read the appropriate sections of the book and take a “quiz”. Some readings are longer than others (and I’ve included the page count in the course schedule so you can be prepared), but every reading quiz is 5 questions, some of which will be practice problems.\nGiven the purpose of the pre-class quizzes, I will not offer extensions, except in case of a major medical or family emergency that causes you to miss class.\n\n\nThere are seven homework sets (one every week except on test weeks) as well as a self-reflection form.\nYou will turn in your work on the homework by scanning and uploading as a PDF to Lyceum. These are due by class time on Friday. You will then have a self-reflection due 72 hours later (by class time on Monday).\nThe problem sets are self-graded. Here’s how that works:\n\nYou get 50% of the points just for submitting the homework on time.\nWhen you submit your work, you will receive access to the (detailed) solutions.\nThe rest of the points come from comparing your work to the solutions and filling out a guided self-reflection form.\nThese forms are not intended to make you do “extra work” – these are to help both you and me understand where you need more practice and more support.\n\nYou may request extensions on the homeworks using the extension form.\n\n\nThere will be three tests on the material in this class. Each test will be offered two times, two weeks apart, giving you two opportunities to achieve your desired grade on the tests. The tests are graded on an E/M/U/N scale, and an E and M are both considered passing grades.\nYou will be provided with an equation sheet for each test, which will have some useful equations, integrals, trig identities, etc. You may also bring a single-sided 8.5”x11” sheet of paper with equations and notes - hand-written (please speak to me if you need to type the sheet and we will come up with a plan). This paper will be turned in with your test.\nIf you have to miss class or leave early on a Friday due to an approved excuse, you may take the test at the testing center. You must do this no more than 2 days before the test is given and no more than 5 days after (i.e. starting the Wednesday before the test and ending the Wednesday after the test), and you can request this option through AESS using this form. This is so I can provide timely feedback to everyone on the test. If you are not sure your absence is excused or you feel you have a special circumstance, come and talk to me about it and we will discuss the options.\nYou don’t have to do anything special to take the test a second time, but I recommend coming to my office hours or scheduling a meeting with me if you are at all confused about what you missed. I am more than happy to help talk you through the test.\n\n\nBy the end of this class, you will have had two semesters of instruction in quantum mechanics and be well-versed in the fundamentals and how to use the mathematics to derive real-world measurements. Now, you get a chance to pick something about quantum mechanics that you want to know more about and dig deeply.\nThis project is designed to be open-ended. I want you be as creative as you want to be. If you want to con- nect quantum mechanics to the arts, be my guest! If you want to do a deep dive into the historical development of the ideas of quantum mechanics, please enlighten us! If you want to do a computational project where you apply your programming skills to a concept you learned in this class, that would be awesome! If you want to teach a topic from the book that we haven’t covered yet to the rest of the class, we would love that! Want to record a podcast interviewing scientists in the field? Great!\nThink about where you want to stretch your understanding, and let that guide you.\nSince there is so much freedom, I’m building a lot of scaffolding into the process, and that scaffolding will be the basis of the grade. So if you want to take a big risk and try something new, you don’t have to worry that if it doesn’t go well, you will fail. The scaffolding is detailed on Lyceum, and there are five parts: the pitch, the proposal, the annotated bibliography, the progress report, and the final presentation and write-up. You must do the proposal and the final presentation and write-up to pass the class – completing other components of the final project will contribute to higher base letter grades (see the grading scheme for more details.)\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading boosts\nYour base grade will be calculated from the table above, but you can round your grade up in a number of ways.\nI will apply as many grade boosts as you achieve, with one exception:\nYou can only achieve an A+ in this class if you receive a base A grade. The A+ grade does not have an impact on your GPA, and so I am reserving it as a way of acknowledging especially excellent work across the course of the semester. ::: panel-tabset #### Test crusher\nEach additional E you earn above what was required for your base letter grade will round your grade up (max 2 round-ups).\n\nTime Management\nIf you use no more than 3 extension requests all semester, I will round your grade up.\n\n\nCompletionist\nIf you get 100% on the homework or the pre-class quizzes, I will round your grade up (one round-up only).\n\n\nFinal Project Ace\nIf you do go above and beyond expectations on your final project, I will round your grade up (this is at my discretion).\n\n\nGrowth Boost\nIf you demonstrate consistent improvement in your work across the semester, I will round your grade up.\n:::",
