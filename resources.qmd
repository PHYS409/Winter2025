### Crisis resources

[Bates Counseling and Psychological Services](https://www.bates.edu/counseling-psychological-services/#scheduling)

[Bates Title IX and Civil Rights Compliance Office:](https://www.bates.edu/here-to-help/) If you are experiencing harassment or discrimination, you can get help here.

Please note that I am a responsible reporter, which means that I am required to share with the Title IX Coordinator "all knowledge of discrimination harassment, and/or retaliation witnessed or shared with" me.

You can always choose what you reveal to me if you come to speak with me about something that's going on. I won't ever insist that you tell me details that you don't wish to share.

The [confidential Resource Advisor](https://www.bates.edu/here-to-help/cra/) is not required to disclose, and is a great resource if you're facing something big and need some guidance.
